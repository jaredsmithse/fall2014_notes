Chemistry - matter and the changes it undergoes
Measurements - involve numbers and units

In measurements, estimate the last digit. Every unit is exact except the last digit (estimated)

## Significant Figures (Sig Figs)

- All non-zero digits are significant
  - 1.5 has 2 sig figs
- Interior zeros are significant
  - 1.05 has 3 sig figs
- Leading zeros are not significant
  - 0.001050 has 4 sig figs
  - 1.050 x 10^-3
- Trailing zeros may or may not be significant
  - Trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant
  - Zeros at the end of a number without a written decimal point are ambiguous and should be avoided by using scientific notation

## Exact Numbers

- Exact numbers have an unlimited number of significant figures
  - 169 students
  - 1cm is exactly equal to 0.01m
