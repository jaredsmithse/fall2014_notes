Chemistry - Study of matter and the changes it undergoes

We define matter as anything that has mass and takes up space


##  Physical Properties

What are some physical properties?
  - color
  - stator matter
  - melting point
  - boiling point
  - density
  - solubility
  - electric conductivity

##  Physical Changes

  - does not alter the chemical makeup of a substance
  - change is reversible
  - melting of solid ice is a physical change. in this case only change in form takes place and the
     change is reversible

##  Derived Units

Quantity      | Definition                     | Derived Unit
------------- | -------------                  | -------------
area          | Length times length            | m^2
volume        | Area times length              | m^3
density       | Mass per unit volume           | kg/m^3
speed         | Distance per unit time         | m/s
acceleration  | Change in speed per unit time  | m/s^2
force         | Mass times acceleration        | (kg*m)/s^2 (newton, N)
pressure      | Force per unit area            | kg/(m*s^2) (pascal, Pa)
energy        | Force times distance           | (kg*m^2)/s^2 (joule, J)

##  Other Systems

- The metric system isn't the only system of measurement units
- Any arbitrary system of units can be used as long as the specific nature of each unit and its relationship to the physical property measures was defined
- An example would be "English units"

##  Temperature Scales

- Fahrenheit
  - freezing to boiling: 32 - 212 (180)
- Celsius
  - freezing to boiling: 0 - 100 (100)
- Kelvin
  - freezing to boiling: 273 - 373 (100)

### Conversions

- 1 degree celsius == 1 degree kelvin
- Celsius -> Kelvin = t(C) + 273.15 (usually use just 273)
- Celsius -> Fahrenheit = 1.8*t(C) + 32
- Fahrenheit -> Celsius = (t(F) - 32)/1.8

## Density

Density = mass (g) / volume (cm^3)
- Density is an **intensive** property of matter.
  - does not depend on quantity of matter
  - does depend on temperature
- Contrast with **extensive**
  - depends on quantity of matter
  - mass and volume

## Dimensional Analysis

- In dimensional analysis we carry units through all calculations. Always include units in your calculations
- The key to using dimensional analysis is the correct use of **conversion factors** to change one unit into another
