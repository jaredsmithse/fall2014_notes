Chemistry - Study of matter and the changes it undergoes

We define matter as anything that has mass and takes up space


Physical Properties
===
What are some physical properties?
  - color
  - stator matter
  - melting point
  - boiling point
  - density
  - solubility
  - electric conductivity

Physical Changes
===
  - does not alter the chemical makeup of a substance
  - change is reversible
  - melting of solid ice is a physical change. in this case only change in form takes place and the
     change is reversible

Derived Units

Quantity      | Definition                     | Derived Unit
------------- | -------------                  | -------------
area          | Length times length            | m^2
volume        | Area times length              | m^3
density       | Mass per unit volume           | kg/m^3
speed         | Distance per unit time         | m/s
acceleration  | Change in speed per unit time  | m/s^2
force         | Mass times acceleration        | (kg*m)/s^2 (newton, N)
pressure      | Force per unit area            | kg/(m*s^2) (pascal, Pa)
energy        | Force times distance           | (kg*m^2)/s^2 (joule, J)
