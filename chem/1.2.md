Chemistry - Study of matter and the changes it undergoes

We define matter as anything that has mass and takes up space


Physical Properties
======
What are some physical properties?
  - color
  - stator matter
  - melting point
  - boiling point
  - density
  - solubility
  - electric conductivity

Physical Changes

  - does not alter the chemical makeup of a substance
  - change is reversible
  - melting of solid ice is a physical change. in this case only change in form takes place and the
     change is reversible
