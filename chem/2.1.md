### Atom

- An atom consists of a nucleus (protons and neutrons)
- Electrons in space about the nucleus

### Matter
- **Atoms** are the building blocks of matter
- Each **element** is made of the _same kind_ of atom
- A **compound** is made of two or more _different kinds_ of elements

### Periodic Table
- There are 118 elements on the periodic table
- Summarizes chemical and physical properties of the elements
- The modern periodic table is arranged by increasing **atomic numbers**
- Elements are arranged in numbered rows called **periods**
- The vertical columns are called **groups**

#### Regions of the periodic table
- Metals: found on the left side of the table
- Nonmetals: Found on the right side of the table
- Metalloids: Found along the diagonal line between metals and nonmetals

##### Metals
- 90 of the 118 elements are metals
- Common properties:
  - Solid at room temperature (except Mercury which is a liquid)
  - Good conductor of heat and electricity
  - Malleable and ductile

##### Nonmetals
- 17 elements are nonmetals
- Eleven are gases at room temperature (H, N, O, F, Ne)
- Five are solids (C, P, S, Se, I)
- One is a liquid (Br)
- Nonmetals are poort conductors of heat and electricity

##### Metalloids
- Seven elements are metalloids. Their properties are between those of metals and nonmetals
- Metalloids are _semiconductors_

#### Groups
- 1A: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs
- 2A: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra (Alkaline Earth Metals)
- 3A: B, Al, Ga, In, Tl
- 4A: C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb
- 5A: N, P, As, Sb, Bi
- 6A: O, S, Se, Te, Po
- 7A: F, Cl, Br, I, At (Halogens)
- 8A: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn (Noble Gases)

- Some of the elements occur naturally as Diatomic Molecules

#### Law of Conservation of Mass
- in a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed
- total mass of the materials you have before the reaction must equal the total mass of the materials you have at the end
- mass is conserved
