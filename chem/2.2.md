#### Subatomic Particles
- atoms are not indestructible
- atoms are made up of:
  - **protons** (tiny, positively charged particles, inside nucleus)
  - **neutrons** (tiny particles with no charge, inside nucleus)
  - **electrons** (tiny, negatively charged particles)
  - **nucleus** (most of the mass is concentrated in this tiny central core)
- electrons have negligible mass


#### Mass & Weight
- **mass** is the measurement of the amount of matter in an object
- **weight** is the measure of the gravitational force that the earth, moon, or other larger body exerts on an object


#### Atomic weight
- this tells us the mass of one atom of an element relative to one atom of another element
- for example, an O atom is approximately 16 times heavier than an H atom
- after trying several standards, scientists settled on the current one:
  - for atomic mass units (amu or u) the standard is based on carbon:
    - C atom with 6 protons and 6 neutrons is the mass standard
    - 1 atom of carbon with 6 protons and 6 neutrons = 12 u (exactly)

##### Mass Number
- proton and neutrons have masses very close to 1u
- the electron in contrast has about 1/2000 of this value
- the approximate mass of an atom can be estimated if the number of neutrons and protons are known
- the sum of the number of protons and neutrons of an atom is called its mass number

#### Isotopes
- actually most elements in nature are uniform mixtures of two or more kinds of atoms with slightly different masses
- atoms of same element with different masses are called isotopes
- chemically, isotopes have virtually identical chemical properties
- isotopes are distinguished by mass number
  - for example, uranium-235

#### Molar Mass
- how can we figure out how much oxide is produced from a given mass of Mg?
- **The Mole**:
  - How we describe chemical recipes
- 6.022x10^23 is Avogadro's number of particles in a mole of any substance
