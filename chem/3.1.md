### Nuclear Chemistry
- a nuclear reaction changes an atom's nucleus

### Beta Radiation
- A beta particle is an _electron_

### Positron Emission
- A positron has the same nucleus captures one of the surrounding electrons in an atom, thereby converting a _proton to a neutron_

## The Quantum-Mechanical of the Atom
- electrons are incredibly small
  - a single speck of dust has more electrons than the number of people have ever lived on earth
- electron behavior determines much of the behavior of atoms

- classical physics doesn't work to explain certain observations
- needed a new theory, this is where **Quantum** or **Wave Mechanics** comes in

- the quantum-mechanical model explains the manner electrons exist and behave in atoms

### The nature of light, its wave nature
- light is a form of electromagnetic radiation
  - an electric field is a region where an electrically charged particle experiences a force
- all electromagnetic waves move through space at the same, constant speed

### Electromagnetic Radiation
- tht total energy is proportional to the amplitude and frequency of the waves
  - the more frequently the waves strike, the more total force there is
  - the larger the wave amplitude, the more force it has

### Electromagnetic Spectrum
- visible light comprises only a small fraction of _all the wavelengths of light_
  - called the **electromagnetic spectrum**

### The Photoelectric Effect
- it was observed that many metals emit electrons when a light shines on their surface
  - this is called the photoelectric effect
- classic wave theory attributed this effect to the light energy being transferred to the electron
- in experiments with the photoelectric effect, it was observed that there was a maximum wavelength for electrons to be emitted
  - called the **threshold frequency**
  - _regardless of the intensity_

### Einstein's Explanation
- Einstein proposed that the light energy was delivered tot he atoms in packets, called **quanta** or **photons**
- the energy of a photon of light was directly proportional to its frequency
  - inversely proportional to its wavelength
  - the proportionality constant is called **Planck's Constant, (h)** and has the value 6.626x10^-34 J*s
