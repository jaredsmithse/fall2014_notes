- Erwin Schrodinger was the first to successfully apply the concept of the wave nature of matter to electronic structure

#### Principal Quantum Number, n
- characterizes the energy of the electron in a particular orbital
  - corresponds to Bohrs energy level
- n can be any integer >= 1

- the larger the value of n, the more energy the orbital has
- energies are defined as being negative
  - and electron would have #=0 when it just escapes the atom
- the larger the value of n, the larger the orbital

  `En = -2.18x10^-18 J(1/n^2)`

##### **Orbitals are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers**:
- -n = principle (major) quantum number. all orbitals with the same principle quantum number are in the same shell.
  - allowed values: the set of positive integers

- -l = secondary quantum number which devides the orbitals in a shell into smaller groups called subshells
  - allowed values: from 0 to (n-1)

- -m(sub)l = magnetic quantum number which divides the subshells into individual orbitals.
  - allowed values: integers from -l to +l

#### Shells and Subshells
- When n = 1, then l = 0, and m(sub)l = 0
- Therefore, in n = 1, there is 1 type of subshell and that subshell has a single orbital
