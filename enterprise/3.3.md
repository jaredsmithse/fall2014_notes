### Identity Problem
- Objects, by definition, have identity
  - Objects can refer to each other directy via object references
  - examples: (pointer, handle, GUID(Microsoft's implementation of UUID), URL, etc)
- Rows in tables do not have their own "built-in" identity
  - Primary (identifying) keys must be defined
- To save objects to a database, the object references must also be saved
  - Map object references to foreign keys

### Mapping Object Relationships to Relational Models (Approach)
- Have the database management system generate an ID key value for each row
  - An auto-increment column in the table named "ID"

### The "Many" Problem
#### Association Table Mapping Pattern
- Relational data models require that each table column be single-valued
  - Cannot store a "collection" or a "composite" value
  - "First Normal Form" requirement
- That is why **we put the foreign key on the "many" side**

### Mapping Inheritance
#### Single Table Inheritance Pattern
- One table with all attributes
  - Easy to define and modify
  - Wastes space: each row has unused attributes
#### Class Table Inheritance Pattern
- One table per class (both abstract and concrete classes)
  - Conceptually clear mapping from classes to tables
  - Need a *common key* in each class, **or** a key in the common super class used as a foreign key in sublcasses
  - no wasted space
  - slow: joins to fetch a single object's data spread across multiple tables
#### Concrete TAble Inheritance Pattern
- One table for each concrete class
  - Each table has attributes of the class and all of its superclasses
  - Brittle to change: changes in a superclass need to be implemented

### ORM Conclusions
- Object-oriented modeling and relationsal modeling of data and data associations are similar, but different
  - There are standard ways to map the differences
- Later, we wil look at OO mapping
